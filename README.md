# Data Science Projects Repository

Welcome to the Data Science Projects repository! This repository contains two distinct Python scripts for data analysis and manipulation, each addressing specific tasks.

## Project 1: Word List Processor

### Description

The Word List Processor script allows users to read and process a text file containing words. Users can create a new list containing only words or remove non-words from the original list. The script provides options to write the results to an existing file or create a new file to append the results to.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on your local device.

### Getting Started

#### A. Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone or Save the Script:** Download a copy of the script or save it to a preferred location on your computer.
2. **Python Installation:** Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
3. **Run the Script:**
    - Open your terminal/command prompt.
    - Navigate to the script's directory using the `cd` command.
    - Run the script with the command: `python FinalProject_1.py`
4. **Providing Input:**
    - Follow the on-screen prompts to provide the path to a text file (ending with .txt).
    - Choose options to create a new list with words or remove non-words.
5. **Results:**
    - The script will display the processed data and provide options to write the results to a file.

#### B. File Structure

1. `FinalProject_1.py`: The main Python script for word list processing.
2. `sample_text_file.txt`: An example text file for testing the script.

#### C. Note

1. Ensure accurate file paths and follow on-screen prompts ('new' or 'remove') when required.
2. The script is case-insensitive when checking user input.

#### D. Contributing

1. Contributions are welcome! Open issues or submit pull requests for improvements or new features.

## Project 2: Data Analysis and Manipulation Toolkit

### Description

The Data Analysis and Manipulation Toolkit script is designed for various data processing tasks using pandas and NumPy. The script includes functionality for reading CSV files, creating dictionaries, modifying data, and validating information such as social security numbers.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on your local device.

### Getting Started

#### A. Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone or Save the Script:** Download a copy of the script or save it to a preferred location on your computer.
2. **Python Installation:** Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
3. **Run the Script:**
    - Open your terminal/command prompt.
    - Navigate to the script's directory using the `cd` command.
    - Run the script with the command: `python FinalProject_2.py`
4. **Providing Input:**
    - Follow the on-screen prompts to provide the path to a CSV file (ending with .csv) for data processing.
    - Choose options for manipulating data or validating social security numbers.
5. **Results:**
    - The script will display the processed data and provide options for further actions.

#### B. File Structure

1. `FinalProject_2.py`: The main Python script for data analysis and manipulation.
2. `iris_data.csv`: Use this specific CSV file for testing the script. It is in the modules for the INST126 class.

#### C. Note

1. Ensure accurate file paths and follow on-screen prompts ('yes' or 'no') when required.
2. The script is designed to be user-friendly and is case-insensitive for certain inputs.

#### D. Contributing

1. Contributions are welcome! Open issues or submit pull requests for improvements or new features.
